Your AI butler that helps you manage your WhatsApp messages! WhatsApp Butler is a sophisticated AI assistant that helps you access, understand, and manage your WhatsApp conversations with the elegance and efficiency of a professional butler.

## How It Works

WhatsApp Butler is an AI-powered assistant that integrates with your WhatsApp account to help you manage and understand your conversations. By prefixing your messages with `@paimai`, you can ask your butler to search through your chats, summarize conversations, find specific information, and more. The AI processes your requests using Google's Gemini AI and responds directly in your WhatsApp chat, providing you with the same level of service and attention to detail as a professional butler would.

WhatsApp Butler uses Google's Gemini AI for natural language understanding and the WhatsApp MCP server for WhatsApp integration. It can help you:

- üìù Generate summaries of past messages
- üîç Find specific messages with context
- üì§ Forward messages with added context
- üí¨ Process complex queries about conversations
- üß† Maintain context of group interactions
