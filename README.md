Imagine having a personal WhatsApp assistant that understands your needs, finds what you're looking for, and manages your conversations effortlessly. Meet WhatsApp Butler - your elegant AI companion that transforms how you interact with WhatsApp.

## How It Works

WhatsApp Butler seamlessly integrates with your WhatsApp account, bringing the power of AI directly to your conversations. Just like having a personal butler at your service, it's always ready to assist you. All responses from the butler will be delivered in your own personal chat with yourself, keeping your interactions private and organized:

```
You: @paimai Find John's message about the project deadline
Butler: I found this message from John (Yesterday, 3:45 PM):
        "Don't forget our project deadline is this Friday at 5pm. Please submit all files to the shared folder."
        
You: @paimai Summarize today's messages in the family group
Butler: Summary of today's messages in "Family Group":
        - Mom announced she's making lasagna for dinner tonight
        - Dad will be home late, around 8pm
        - Your sister shared photos from her trip to the beach
        - Everyone discussed weekend plans (consensus is movie night on Saturday)
        
You: @paimai What was the address of that restaurant Mark recommended?
Butler: Mark shared this address on Tuesday:
        "Let's try that new Italian place, Bella Cucina at 123 Main Street. They have amazing pasta!"
```

üí° **Tip:** For a cleaner experience, use the assistant in your personal chat with yourself. Since all responses are sent from your own account (not a separate "butler" contact), this keeps other conversations uncluttered and helps maintain context without confusing others.


The magic happens through a simple prefix command - just start your message with `@paimai` (or customize your own prefix), and your butler instantly knows you need assistance. Behind the scenes, WhatsApp Butler:

1. **Monitors your conversations** - Listens for your command prefix in any chat
2. **Processes your request** - Uses Google's Gemini AI to understand exactly what you need
3. **Searches your WhatsApp data** - Finds relevant messages, contacts, and information
4. **Delivers precise responses** - Replies directly in your chat with exactly what you asked for

WhatsApp Butler can help you:

- üìù Generate smart summaries of conversations (perfect for catching up on busy group chats)
- üîç Find that elusive message with specific information (addresses, phone numbers, meeting details)
- üì§ Forward important messages with added context (save time explaining background information)
- üí¨ Answer complex questions about your conversations (who said what and when)
- üß† Maintain context between requests (have natural, flowing interactions)

1. Clone the repository with submodules:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/andrepaim/whatsapp-watchdog.git
cd whatsapp-watchdog
```

2. Create a `.env` file with required variables:
```bash
# WhatsApp API Configuration
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=your_whatsapp_api_key
WHATSAPP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

- Manages message operations
- Provides REST API endpoints
- Maintains persistent session

### WhatsApp MCP Service 
- Provides Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Handles real-time message streaming
- Connects to WhatsApp API service
- Processes message events

### Webhook Service 
- Processes incoming webhook requests
- Integrates with Google's Gemini AI
- Manages conversation context
- Generates AI responses

```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and start services:
```bash
make docker-compose-up
```

2. Monitor service health:
```bash
make docker-compose-logs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Session Data Issues**
   - Location: `whatsapp-session-data/`
   - Solution: Remove directory and restart services

2. **Service Start Failures**
   - Check logs: `make docker-compose-logs`
   - Verify API keys in `.env`
   - Check webhook configuration

3. **QR Code Authentication**
   - Ensure WhatsApp API service is running
   - Check logs for QR code display
   - Verify session data permissions

### Debugging

1. Check service logs:
```bash
make docker-compose-logs
```

2. Verify service health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Maintenance

### Session Management

- Session data is stored in `whatsapp-session-data/`
- Regular cleanup recommended
- Backup before updates

### Security Considerations

- Keep API keys secure
- Regular updates of dependencies
- Monitor service logs
- Review allowed numbers in `webhook.json`
